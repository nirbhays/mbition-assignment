User Story
As a manager, I need an easy and intuitive way to display all users existing in our DevOps platform.
The raw user data is available behind this API:  https://reqres.in/api/users
Additional information about the API is found here:  https://reqres.in/
 
Requirements
Your implementation must fulfil the following functional requirements:
•	The application presents the list of users in a user-friendly format, like an HTML page, Excel, PDF file, etc.
•	Your code must be stored in a code repository which should be shared with us for assessment.
•	Your application must be bundled as a docker container. i.e. there should be a dockerfile in your solution.
•	CI/CD pipeline needs to be implemented with the following functionality: 
o	checks-out, builds and tests your application when a change is pushed to the repository
o	releases and deploys new versions of your application
Bonus points for fulfilling the following quality requirement:
•	The code can include unit tests, ideally up to 100% coverage.
 
Remarks
•	You can build the application using the languages and technology stacks of your choice.
•	The pipelines can be implemented in any CI/CD system you prefer.
•	You can use any service to host your code in a private repository that allows you to share it with us only.
 
References
TODO:
•	List here references to free-to-use git and ci-cd services so the candidate can use them.
•	Provide some docker-based system the candidate can pull and use as well
•	Provide a reference solution to the problem and objective checkpoints to be compared against the candidate's solution
